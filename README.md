# Devsign Notes, Budget Tracker Lab

## UX Strategy

You aren't expected to formally complete the UX Strategy process due to lack of time, but you should discuss the following questions with your partner as you sketch your Budget Tracker layout.

* **Who is this app for?** 
* **What are the use circumstances for different types of users?**
* **Who is the competition?**

   There's a lot of budget tracking apps out there alreadyâ€“there's 25 here listed at [Best Budgeting and Personal Finance Apps](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/548-best-budget-expense-apps.html#s2). Think about

   * What features are common to the highest-rated budgeting apps?
   * What distinguishes a usable app from a quickly abandoned one?

## Accessibility

As you develop, keep your eye on the [React Accessibility Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html). It's a valuable collection of checklists and resources.

Because React is new to us, it's easy to forget to apply principles we've already covered, such as

### Skip to desired content

* [Skip Navigation Links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/) for screen readers
* [Landmark Roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/html/jquery-summit/html5/slides/landmarks.html)

### Accessible forms

* Review and apply [How to structure an HTML form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/How_to_structure_an_HTML_form) at MDN
* Note that JSX uses `htmlFor` in place of `for`:

   ```
   <label htmlFor="userName">Name:</label>
   <input id="userName" type="text" name="name"/>
   ```

* The MDN article recommends using `for` (or in this case, `htmlFor`) **even if the form widget is nested within a `label`**:

   ```
   <label htmlFor="userName">
     Name: <input type="text" id="userName" name="name"/>
   </label>
   ```
